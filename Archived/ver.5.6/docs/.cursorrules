# Cursor Rules (v6.7 aligned)
# Repository-wide constraints for Cursor / coding agents.

## Hard Rules
- Do NOT add any new features beyond what is explicitly specified in repo docs.
- Phase 1 is read-only (no code changes).
- If critical execution decisions are missing, write an RFC in `docs/00_context/PRD_NOTES.md` and STOP.
- Keep a running execution log with 🔲/✅ checkboxes in PRD_NOTES.

## Anti-Block Requirements (MUST)
Before implementation, ensure `docs/00_context/PRD_NOTES.md` contains:
- Foundational Setup Decisions (LOCKED): stack + monorepo layout + ports + env + run commands (PowerShell + CMD for Windows) + tooling.
And ensure:
- `docs/00_context/PRD_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md` exists and maps requirements → API/DB/Worker/UI/Tests.

## Task Discipline
- Work task-by-task from `docs/10_product/TASKS.md`.
- For each task:
  - modify ONLY the task’s listed file set
  - run the task’s verification commands
  - update PRD_NOTES checklist

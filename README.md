## 🎨 Development Phases

### Phase 0: START
```
AI greets user in their language
Explains the process
Asks what they want to build
```

### Phase 1: DISCOVERY (Chat Mode)
```
AI asks strategic questions:
- What problem does this solve?
- Who are the users?
- What are the core features?
- Any constraints (time, budget, scale)?

AI extracts:
- User personas
- Use cases
- Data entities
- Scale requirements
```

### Phase 2: PLANNING (Chat Mode)
```
AI proposes:
- Complete feature list (MVP vs Later vs Never)
- Technology options (with pros/cons/evidence)
- Architecture approach
- Timeline estimate
- Cost projection

User approves each decision
AI documents everything
```

### Phase 3: BUILD (Execution Mode)
```
Triggered by: "BUILD" or "بساز"

AI generates:
- All documentation (30+ files)
- Complete source code
- Configuration files
- Tests (80%+ coverage)
- README and guides

AI updates PROGRESS.md after each task
AI suggests next steps proactively
```

### Phase 4: DELIVERY
```
AI performs:
- Security scan (auto-check)
- Quality gates validation
- Test coverage verification
- Documentation completeness
- Final README generation

AI packages:
- ZIP file with everything
- Clear installation instructions
- Quick start guide
```

     Approve?"

User: "Yes"

AI: "Technology choices:
     
     Frontend: React vs Vue vs Svelte
     [Shows pros/cons/evidence for each]
     My recommendation: React
     Reason: [specific rationale]
     
     Your choice?"

User: "React"

AI: "Perfect! Ready to build?
     
     Timeline: 2 weeks
     Cost: $25 (using Claude Sonnet)
     Deliverable: Complete app + docs
     
     Say 'BUILD' when ready"

User: "BUILD"

AI: [Generates all files, provides progress updates]

AI: "📦 Project complete!
     
     [Download ZIP - 2.3MB]
     
     Quick start:
     1. Extract ZIP
     2. npm install

# Cursor Rules (v6.5 aligned)
# These are repository-wide constraints for any AI agent working in Cursor.


## Execution Principles (Do not violate)
- Treat `docs/00_context/PRD.md` as immutable after it is generated. Never rewrite PRD content unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- Work strictly task-by-task using `docs/10_product/TASKS.md`.
- For each task: modify ONLY the task’s “Files to Touch” unless the task explicitly expands scope.
- Always run the task’s Verification Steps and record results in `docs/90_ops/CHANGELOG.md`.
- If blocked: write a clear entry to `docs/00_context/PRD_NOTES.md` (execution-time blocker), mark the task BLOCKED, and STOP.
- No broad refactors. No “cleanup” PRs. No architectural changes unless a task explicitly requires it.
- Keep outputs concise: `DONE`/`BLOCKED`, task id(s), changed files, verify commands run, next task.


## Additional Constraints
- Prefer small, reviewable commits/patches.
- If tests are missing, create minimal smoke checks only when required by a task.
- Never “improve” unrelated code.

# Cursor Rules — Project Guardrails

You must treat /docs as canonical documentation.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- docs/00_context/PRD.md is IMMUTABLE. Never edit or rewrite it.
- If blocked: write questions/options to docs/00_context/PRD_NOTES.md and STOP.
- Execute tasks strictly in docs/10_product/TASKS.md order. One task at a time.
- After each task: append an entry to docs/90_ops/CHANGELOG.md.

ENGINEERING DISCIPLINE
- Minimal changes only; avoid broad refactors unless a task explicitly requires it.
- Follow docs/20_engineering/RULES.md (testing, security, style).
- Do not invent features. Implement only what PRD/SPEC/TASKS specify.

OUTPUT DISCIPLINE
- Keep chat responses concise: DONE/BLOCKED, completed task id, next task id.
- Reference file paths; do not paste whole files.
